An open source application built using the new router, server components and everything new in Next.js 14.

## About this project

This project as an experiment to see how a modern app (with features like authentication, subscriptions, API routes, static pages for docs ...etc) would work in Next.js 13 and server components.

**This is not a starter template.**

A few people have asked me to turn this into a starter. I think we could do that once the new features are out of beta.

## Features

- New `/app` dir,
- Routing, Layouts, Nested Layouts and Layout Groups
- Data Fetching, Caching and Mutation
- Loading UI
- Route handlers
- Metadata files
- Server and Client Components
- API Routes and Middlewares
- Authentication using **NextAuth.js**
- ORM using **Prisma**
- Database on **PlanetScale**
- UI Components built using **Radix UI**
- Documentation and blog using **MDX** and **Contentlayer**
- Subscriptions using **Stripe**
- Styled using **Tailwind CSS**
- Validations using **Zod**
- Written in **TypeScript**

## Roadmap

- [ ] ~Contentlayer migration

## Known Issues

A list of things not working right now:

1. ~GitHub authentication (use email)~
2. ~[Prisma: Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/var/task/.next/server/chunks/schema.prisma'](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/16117)~
3. [Cannot use opengraph-image.tsx inside catch-all routes](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/48162)

## Running Locally

1. Install dependencies using pnpm:

```sh
pnpm install
```

2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and update the variables.

```sh
cp .env.example .env.local
```

3. Start the development server:

```sh
pnpm dev
```
